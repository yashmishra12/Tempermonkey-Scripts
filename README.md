# Tempermonkey-Scripts
Tempermonkey userscripts to ease your daily struggles. (Well, my daily struggles on the internet) 

1. Play Icon Remover on Udemy
Summary: Removes play icon from Udemy videos whenever the videos are paused. 

Description: Udemy is an excellent platform to learn new things. More often than not, I find myself pausing the video either to see what's on my screen or take 
a screenshot of the code by the tutor for future reference. But an annoying play icon apprears whenever you pause your video. You can copy the code in a new 
Tempermonkey script and allow the script to run on Udemy. (With the script open, go to Settings -> Includes/Excludes -> User Matches -> Type https://www.udemy.com/*
Then add the match. 


2. Input Focus
Summary: Brings the cursor to a search field. Easily modifiable and you can choose your websites

Description: Having migrated to Safari from Chrome, I found myself missing the excellent extension named: "Focus on first input (keyboard shortcut)" by Michael Clark.
So I made my own on Safari. My shortcut is Alt + S. You can choose yours, just change the keycode accordingly. You can find your keycode from http://keycode.info
Use inspect element to copy the Javascript path of the search input you wish to focus and follow my example. Remember to add your website match too (told how to
add matches above)
